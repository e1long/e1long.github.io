    <img src="ITM752 Dashboard.png" alt="Tableau Dashboard Screenshot" width="90%" class="indented-image" cursor: pointer;>

    <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
    <h3>This project explores how stress levels and guilt impact shopping behavior among university students. By examining factors like gender, spending categories, and perceived financial comfort, we aimed to uncover patterns in student spending behavior and its relationship to stress.</h3>

    <h2><b>Objective</b></h2>
    <h3>To identify correlations between stress levels and shopping behavior among university students, specifically analyzing guilt thresholds, gender differences, and financial comfort levels.</h3>

    <h2><b>Process</b></h2>
    <h3>    1. <b>Data Collection and Cleaning</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted surveys to collect data on stress triggers, spending habits, and financial comfort levels.</li>
        <li>Cleaned and standardized the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>    2. <b>Analysis and Visualization</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilized Tableau for data visualization, creating an interactive dashboard to display insights.</li>
        <li>Analyzed the relationship between stress triggers (e.g., academics, finances) and spending categories (e.g., clothing, food).</li>
        <li>Examined gender-based differences in average stress levels and guilt thresholds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>    3. <b>Insights and Findings</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Key insights included the strong link between financial comfort and spending behaviors.</li>
        <li>Discovered that students with higher stress tended to engage in specific spending categories, like food and convenience items.</li>
        <li>Female students tend to feel a higher guilt when stress buying compared to male students.</li>
    </ul>
